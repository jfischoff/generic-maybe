{- | This module is a drop in replacement for 'Data.Maybe.Maybe'. It generalizes
 the functions to any types that share the same \"sum of products\" view
 of 'Data.Maybe.Maybe'.
 
 To use the module for you type, enable GHC's DeriveGeneric extension and
 derive a Generic instance for your type.
 
 @
import GHC.Generics
      
 data Result a = Success a | Fail
   deriving (Show, Generic)

 data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat
   deriving (Show, Generic)
 @
 
 After which you can use the function, like your type was 'Data.Maybe.Maybe'
